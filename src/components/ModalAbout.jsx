                            To be specific; a bastardly mix between vanilla Bootstrap and <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React-Bootstrap</a>. 
                            Also, somewhat doggedly, made with bunch of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> in a heap of external files, because I'm 
                            not ready to accept the React-philosophy of inline-styles just yet.
